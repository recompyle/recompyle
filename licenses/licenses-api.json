Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

For example the `es6-promise` library exposes itself\nas `global.Promise` rather than `global.es6Promise`. This can be accommodated by:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"es6-promise\": \"Promise\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Default semantics\n\nThere are a few things to note about the default semantics.\n\n_First_, this transform uses the\n[basename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename) of each import to generate\nthe global names in the UMD output. This means that if you're importing\nmultiple modules with the same basename, like:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nit will transpile into two references to the same browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.fooBar);\n```\n\nIf you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nit will still transpile both to one browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.fooBAR);\n```\n\nbecause again the transform is only using the basename of the import.\n\n_Second_, the specified override will still be passed to the `toIdentifier`\nfunction in [babel-types/src/converters](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-types/src/converters.js).\nThis means that if you specify an override as a member expression like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"fizzbuzz\": \"fizz.buzz\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nthis will _not_ transpile to `factory(global.fizz.buzz)`. Instead, it will\ntranspile to `factory(global.fizzBuzz)` based on the logic in `toIdentifier`.\n\n_Third_, you cannot override the exported global name.\n\n#### More flexible semantics with `exactGlobals: true`\n\nAll of these behaviors can limit the flexibility of the `globals` map. To\nremove these limitations, you can set the `exactGlobals` option to `true`.\nDoing this instructs the plugin to:\n\n1. always use the full import string instead of the basename when generating\nthe global names\n2. skip passing `globals` overrides to the `toIdentifier` function. Instead,\nthey are used exactly as written, so you will get errors if you do not use\nvalid identifiers or valid uncomputed (dot) member expressions.\n3. allow the exported global name to be overridden via the `globals` map. Any\noverride must again be a valid identifier or valid member expression.\n\nThus, if you set `exactGlobals` to `true` and do not pass any overrides, the\nfirst example of:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nwill transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.mylibFooBar);\n```\n\nAnd if you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  },\n  \"exactGlobals\": true\n}\n```\n\nthen it'll transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.mylib.fooBar)\n```\n\nFinally, with the plugin options set to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"external-helpers\",\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"my/custom/module/name\": \"My.Custom.Module.Name\"\n      },\n      \"exactGlobals\": true\n    }]\n  ],\n  \"moduleId\": \"my/custom/module/name\"\n}\n```\n\nit will transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(mod.exports);\nglobal.My = global.My || {};\nglobal.My.Custom = global.My.Custom || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module = global.My.Custom.Module || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module.Name = mod.exports;\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-es2015-modules-umd script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\"]\n});\n```"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   Copyright 2020 MongoDB Inc.\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "Railroad-diagram Generator\n==========================\n\nThis is a small js library for generating railroad diagrams\n(like what [JSON.org](http://json.org) uses)\nusing SVG.\n\nRailroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar\nin a form that is more readable than using regular expressions or BNF.\nI think (though I haven't given it a lot of thought yet) that if it's easy to write a context-free grammar for the language,\nthe corresponding railroad diagram will be easy as well.\n\nThere are several railroad-diagram generators out there, but none of them had the visual appeal I wanted.\n[Here's an example of how they look!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/example.html)\nAnd [here's an online generator for you to play with and get SVG code from!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/generator.html)\n\nThe library now exists in a Python port as well!  See the information further down.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nTo use the library, just include the js and css files, and then call the Diagram() function.\nIts arguments are the components of the diagram (Diagram is a special form of Sequence).\nAn alternative to Diagram() is ComplexDiagram() which is used to describe a complex type diagram.\nComponents are either leaves or containers.\n\nThe leaves:\n* Terminal(text) or a bare string - represents literal text\n* NonTerminal(text) - represents an instruction or another production\n* Comment(text) - a comment\n* Skip() - an empty line\n\nThe containers:\n* Sequence(children) - like simple concatenation in a regex\n* Choice(index, children) - like | in a regex.  The index argument specifies which child is the \"normal\" choice and should go in the middle\n* Optional(child, skip) - like ? in a regex.  A shorthand for `Choice(1, [Skip(), child])`.  If the optional `skip` parameter has the value `\"skip\"`, it instead puts the Skip() in the straight-line path, for when the \"normal\" behavior is to omit the item.\n* OneOrMore(child, repeat) - like + in a regex.  The 'repeat' argument is optional, and specifies something that must go between the repetitions.\n* ZeroOrMore(child, repeat, skip) - like * in a regex.  A shorthand for `Optional(OneOrMore(child, repeat))`.  The optional `skip` parameter is identical to Optional().\n\nFor convenience, each component can be called with or without `new`.\nIf called without `new`,\nthe container components become n-ary;\nthat is, you can say either `new Sequence([A, B])` or just `Sequence(A,B)`.\n\nAfter constructing a Diagram, call `.format(...padding)` on it, specifying 0-4 padding values (just like CSS) for some additional \"breathing space\" around the diagram (the paddings default to 20px).\n\nThe result can either be `.toString()`'d for the markup, or `.toSVG()`'d for an `<svg>` element, which can then be immediately inserted to the document.  As a convenience, Diagram also has an `.addTo(element)` method, which immediately converts it to SVG and appends it to the referenced element with default paddings. `element` defaults to `document.body`.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThere are a few options you can tweak, at the bottom of the file.  Just tweak either until the diagram looks like what you want.\nYou can also change the CSS file - feel free to tweak to your heart's content.\nNote, though, that if you change the text sizes in the CSS,\nyou'll have to go adjust the metrics for the leaf nodes as well.\n\n* VERTICAL_SEPARATION - sets the minimum amount of vertical separation between two items.  Note that the stroke width isn't counted when computing the separation; this shouldn't be relevant unless you have a very small separation or very large stroke width.\n* ARC_RADIUS - the radius of the arcs used in the branching containers like Choice.  This has a relatively large effect on the size of non-trivial diagrams.  Both tight and loose values look good, depending on what you're going for.\n* DIAGRAM_CLASS - the class set on the root `<svg>` element of each diagram, for use in the CSS stylesheet.\n* STROKE_ODD_PIXEL_LENGTH - the default stylesheet uses odd pixel lengths for 'stroke'. Due to rasterization artifacts, they look best when the item has been translated half a pixel in both directions. If you change the styling to use a stroke with even pixel lengths, you'll want to set this variable to `false`.\n* INTERNAL_ALIGNMENT - when some branches of a container are narrower than others, this determines how they're aligned in the extra space.  Defaults to \"center\", but can be set to \"left\" or \"right\".\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nAt this early stage, the generator is feature-complete and works as intended, but still has several TODOs:\n\n* The font-sizes are hard-coded right now, and the font handling in general is very dumb - I'm just guessing at some metrics that are probably \"good enough\" rather than measuring things properly.\n\nPython Port\n-----------\n\nIn addition to the canonical JS version, the library now exists as a Python library as well.\n\nUsing it is basically identical.  The config variables are globals in the file, and so may be adjusted either manually or via tweaking from inside your program.\n\nThe main difference from the JS port is how you extract the string from the Diagram.  You'll find a `writeSvg(writerFunc)` method on `Diagram`, which takes a callback of one argument and passes it the string form of the diagram.  For example, it can be used like `Diagram(...).writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)` to write to stdout.  **Note**: the callback will be called multiple times as it builds up the string, not just once with the whole thing.  If you need it all at once, consider something like a `StringIO` as an easy way to collect it into a single string.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis document and all associated files in the github project are licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ![](http://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png).\nThis means you can reuse, remix, or otherwise appropriate this project for your own use **without restriction**.\n(The actual legal meaning can be found at the above link.)\nDon't ask me for permission to use any part of this project, **just use it**.\nI would appreciate attribution, but that is not required by the license."

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "**Installation**: `npm install sift`, or `yarn add sift`\n\n## Sift is a tiny library for using MongoDB queries in Javascript\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/crcn/sift.js.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/crcn/sift.js)\n\n<!-- [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/crcn/sift.js/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/crcn/sift.js)  -->\n<!-- [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/crcn/sift.js](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/crcn/sift.js?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) -->\n\n**For extended documentation, checkout http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/**\n\n## Features:\n\n- Supported operators: [\\$in](#in), [\\$nin](#nin), [\\$exists](#exists), [\\$gte](#gte), [\\$gt](#gt), [\\$lte](#lte), [\\$lt](#lt), [\\$eq](#eq), [\\$ne](#ne), [\\$mod](#mod), [\\$all](#all), [\\$and](#and), [\\$or](#or), [\\$nor](#nor), [\\$not](#not), [\\$size](#size), [\\$type](#type), [\\$regex](#regex), [\\$where](#where), [\\$elemMatch](#elemmatch)\n- Regexp searches\n- Supports node.js, and web\n- Custom Operations\n- Tree-shaking (omitting functionality from web app bundles)\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nimport sift from \"sift\";\n\n//intersecting arrays\nconst result1 = [\"hello\", \"sifted\", \"array!\"].filter(\n  sift({ $in: [\"hello\", \"world\"] })\n); //['hello']\n\n//regexp filter\nconst result2 = [\"craig\", \"john\", \"jake\"].filter(sift(/^j/)); //['john','jake']\n\n// function filter\nconst testFilter = sift({\n  //you can also filter against functions\n  name: function(value) {\n    return value.length == 5;\n  }\n});\n\nconst result3 = [\n  {\n    name: \"craig\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"john\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"jake\"\n  }\n].filter(testFilter); // filtered: [{ name: 'craig' }]\n\n//you can test *single values* against your custom sifter\ntestFilter({ name: \"sarah\" }); //true\ntestFilter({ name: \"tim\" }); //false\n```\n\n## API\n\n### sift(query: MongoQuery, options?: Options): Function\n\nCreates a filter with all of the built-in MongoDB query operations.\n\n- `query` - the filter to use against the target array\n- `options`\n  - `operations` - [custom operations](#custom-operations)\n  - `compare` - compares difference between two values\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport sift from \"sift\";\n\nconst test = sift({ $gt: 5 }));\n\nconsole.log(test(6)); // true\nconsole.log(test(4)); // false\n\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7].filter(sift({ $exists: true })); // [6, 7]\n```\n\n### createQueryTester(query: Query, options?: Options): Function\n\nCreates a filter function **without** built-in MongoDB query operations. This is useful\nif you're looking to omit certain operations from application bundles. See [Omitting built-in operations](#omitting-built-in-operations) for more info.\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, $eq, $in } from \"sift\";\nconst filter = createQueryTester({ $eq: 5 }, { operations: { $eq, $in } });\n```\n\n### createEqualsOperation(params: any, ownerQuery: Query, options: Options): Operation\n\nUsed for [custom operations](#custom-operations).\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, createEqualsOperation, $eq, $in } from \"sift\";\nconst filter = createQueryTester(\n  { $mod: 5 },\n  {\n    operations: {\n      $something(mod, ownerQuery, options) {\n        return createEqualsOperation(\n          value => value % mod === 0,\n          ownerQuery,\n          options\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\nfilter(10); // true\nfilter(11); // false\n```\n\n## Supported Operators\n\nSee MongoDB's [advanced queries](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries) for more info.\n\n### \\$in\n\narray value must be _\\$in_ the given query:\n\nIntersecting two arrays:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Brazil']\n[\"Brazil\", \"Haiti\", \"Peru\", \"Chile\"].filter(\n  sift({ $in: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] })\n);\n```\n\nHere's another example. This acts more like the \\$or operator:\n\n```javascript\n[{ name: \"Craig\", location: \"Brazil\" }].filter(\n  sift({ location: { $in: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$nin\n\nOpposite of \\$in:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Haiti','Peru','Chile']\n[\"Brazil\", \"Haiti\", \"Peru\", \"Chile\"].filter(\n  sift({ $nin: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$exists\n\nChecks if whether a value exists:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Craig','Tim']\nsift({ $exists: true })([\"Craig\", null, \"Tim\"]);\n```\n\nYou can also filter out values that don't exist\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ name: \"Tim\" }]\n[{ name: \"Craig\", city: \"Minneapolis\" }, { name: \"Tim\" }].filter(\n  sift({ city: { $exists: false } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$gte\n\nChecks if a number is >= value:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [2, 3]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gte: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$gt\n\nChecks if a number is > value:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [3]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gt: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$lte\n\nChecks if a number is <= value.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [0, 1, 2]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lte: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$lt\n\nChecks if number is < value.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [0, 1]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lt: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$eq\n\nChecks if `query === value`. Note that **\\$eq can be omitted**. For **\\$eq**, and **\\$ne**\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: { $eq: \"MN\" } })\n);\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: \"MN\" })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$ne\n\nChecks if `query !== value`.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI'}]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: { $ne: \"MN\" } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$mod\n\nModulus:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [300, 600]\n[100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600].filter(sift({ $mod: [3, 0] }));\n```\n\n### \\$all\n\nvalues must match **everything** in array:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { tags: ['books','programming','travel' ]} ]\n[\n  { tags: [\"books\", \"programming\", \"travel\"] },\n  { tags: [\"travel\", \"cooking\"] }\n].filter(sift({ tags: { $all: [\"books\", \"programming\"] } }));\n```\n\n### \\$and\n\nability to use an array of expressions. All expressions must test true.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }]\n\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $and: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$or\n\nOR array of expressions.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }, { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' }]\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $or: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$nor\n\nopposite of or:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' }]\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $nor: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$size\n\nMatches an array - must match given size:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['food','cooking']\n[{ tags: [\"food\", \"cooking\"] }, { tags: [\"traveling\"] }].filter(\n  sift({ tags: { $size: 2 } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$type\n\nMatches a values based on the type\n\n```javascript\n[new Date(), 4342, \"hello world\"].filter(sift({ $type: Date })); //returns single date\n[new Date(), 4342, \"hello world\"].filter(sift({ $type: String })); //returns ['hello world']\n```\n\n### \\$regex\n\nMatches values based on the given regular expression\n\n```javascript\n[\"frank\", \"fred\", \"sam\", \"frost\"].filter(\n  sift({ $regex: /^f/i, $nin: [\"frank\"] })\n); // [\"fred\", \"frost\"]\n[\"frank\", \"fred\", \"sam\", \"frost\"].filter(\n  sift({ $regex: \"^f\", $options: \"i\", $nin: [\"frank\"] })\n); // [\"fred\", \"frost\"]\n```\n\n### \\$where\n\nMatches based on some javascript comparison\n\n```javascript\n[{ name: \"frank\" }, { name: \"joe\" }].filter(\n  sift({ $where: \"this.name === 'frank'\" })\n); // [\"frank\"]\n[{ name: \"frank\" }, { name: \"joe\" }].filter(\n  sift({\n    $where: function() {\n      return this.name === \"frank\";\n    }\n  })\n); // [\"frank\"]\n```\n\n### \\$elemMatch\n\nMatches elements of array\n\n```javascript\nvar bills = [\n  {\n    month: \"july\",\n    casts: [\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        value: 200\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        value: 1000\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    month: \"august\",\n    casts: [\n      {\n        id: 3,\n        value: 1000\n      },\n      {\n        id: 4,\n        value: 4000\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n];\n\nvar result = bills.filter(\n  sift({\n    casts: {\n      $elemMatch: {\n        value: { $gt: 1000 }\n      }\n    }\n  })\n); // {month:'august', casts:[{id:3, value: 1000},{id: 4, value: 4000}]}\n```\n\n### \\$not\n\nNot expression:\n\n```javascript\n[\"craig\", \"tim\", \"jake\"].filter(sift({ $not: { $in: [\"craig\", \"tim\"] } })); //['jake']\n[\"craig\", \"tim\", \"jake\"].filter(sift({ $not: { $size: 5 } })); //['tim','jake']\n```\n\n### Date comparison\n\nMongodb allows you to do date comparisons like so:\n\n```javascript\ndb.collection.find({ createdAt: { $gte: \"2018-03-22T06:00:00Z\" } });\n```\n\nIn Sift, you'll need to specify a Date object:\n\n```javascript\ncollection.find(\n  sift({ createdAt: { $gte: new Date(\"2018-03-22T06:00:00Z\") } })\n);\n```\n\n## Custom behavior\n\nSift works like MongoDB out of the box, but you're also able to modify the behavior to suite your needs.\n\n#### Custom operations\n\nYou can register your own custom operations. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport sift, { createEqualsOperation } from \"sift\";\n\nvar filter = sift(\n  {\n    $customMod: 2\n  },\n  {\n    operations: {\n      $customMod(params, ownerQuery, options) {\n        return createEqualsOperation(\n          value => value % params !== 0,\n          ownerQuery,\n          options\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(filter); // 1, 3, 5\n```\n\n#### Omitting built-in operations\n\nYou can create a filter function that omits the built-in operations like so:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, $in, $all, $nin, $lt } from \"sift\";\nconst test = createQueryTester(\n  {\n    $eq: 10\n  },\n  { operations: { $in, $all, $nin, $lt } }\n);\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 10].filter(test);\n```\n\nFor bundlers like `Webpack` and `Rollup`, operations that aren't used are omitted from application bundles via tree-shaking."

from\nsmall applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications\nwith multiple databases.\n\nTypeORM supports both [Active Record](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns,\nunlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence,\nwhich means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,\nmaintainable applications the most productive way.\n\nTypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),\n[Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).\n\n## Features\n\n-   Supports both [DataMapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) and [ActiveRecord](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) (your choice).\n-   Entities and columns.\n-   Database-specific column types.\n-   Entity manager.\n-   Repositories and custom repositories.\n-   Clean object relational model.\n-   Associations (relations).\n-   Eager and lazy relations.\n-   Uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations.\n-   Supports multiple inheritance patterns.\n-   Cascades.\n-   Indices.\n-   Transactions.\n-   Migrations and automatic migrations generation.\n-   Connection pooling.\n-   Replication.\n-   Using multiple database instances.\n-   Working with multiple databases types.\n-   Cross-database and cross-schema queries.\n-   Elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder.\n-   Left and inner joins.\n-   Proper pagination for queries using joins.\n-   Query caching.\n-   Streaming raw results.\n-   Logging.\n-   Listeners and subscribers (hooks).\n-   Supports closure table pattern.\n-   Schema declaration in models or separate configuration files.\n-   Supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / CockroachDB / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / SAP Hana / sql.js.\n-   Supports MongoDB NoSQL database.\n-   Works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms.\n-   TypeScript and JavaScript support.\n-   ESM and CommonJS support.\n-   Produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable.\n-   Follows all possible best practices.\n-   CLI.\n\nAnd more...\n\nWith TypeORM your models look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class User {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    firstName: string\n\n    @Column()\n    lastName: string\n\n    @Column()\n    age: number\n}\n```\n\nAnd your domain logic looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst userRepository = MyDataSource.getRepository(User)\n\nconst user = new User()\nuser.firstName = \"Timber\"\nuser.lastName = \"Saw\"\nuser.age = 25\nawait userRepository.save(user)\n\nconst allUsers = await userRepository.find()\nconst firstUser = await userRepository.findOneBy({\n    id: 1,\n}) // find by id\nconst timber = await userRepository.findOneBy({\n    firstName: \"Timber\",\n    lastName: \"Saw\",\n}) // find by firstName and lastName\n\nawait userRepository.remove(timber)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to use the `ActiveRecord` implementation, you can use it as well:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, BaseEntity } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class User extends BaseEntity {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    firstName: string\n\n    @Column()\n    lastName: string\n\n    @Column()\n    age: number\n}\n```\n\nAnd your domain logic will look this way:\n\n```javascript\nconst user = new User()\nuser.firstName = \"Timber\"\nuser.lastName = \"Saw\"\nuser.age = 25\nawait user.save()\n\nconst allUsers = await User.find()\nconst firstUser = await User.findOneBy({\n    id: 1,\n})\nconst timber = await User.findOneBy({\n    firstName: \"Timber\",\n    lastName: \"Saw\"\n})\n\nawait timber.remove()\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install the npm package:\n\n    `npm install typeorm --save`\n\n2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:\n\n    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`\n\n    and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):\n\n    `import \"reflect-metadata\"`\n\n3. You may need to install node typings:\n\n    `npm install @types/node --save-dev`\n\n4. Install a database driver:\n\n    - for **MySQL** or **MariaDB**\n\n        `npm install mysql --save` (you can install `mysql2` instead as well)\n\n    - for **PostgreSQL** or **CockroachDB**\n\n        `npm install pg --save`\n\n    - for **SQLite**\n\n        `npm install sqlite3 --save`\n\n    - for **Microsoft SQL Server**\n\n        `npm install mssql --save`\n\n    - for **sql.js**\n\n        `npm install sql.js --save`\n\n    - for **Oracle**\n\n        `npm install oracledb --save`\n\n        To make the Oracle driver work, you need to follow the installation instructions from\n        [their](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) site.\n\n    - for **SAP Hana**\n\n        ```\n        npm install @sap/hana-client\n        npm install hdb-pool\n        ```\n\n        _SAP Hana support made possible by the sponsorship of [Neptune Software](https://www.neptune-software.com/)._\n\n    - for **Google Cloud Spanner**\n\n        ```\n        npm install @google-cloud/spanner --save\n        ```\n\n        Provide authentication credentials to your application code\n        by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:\n\n        ```shell\n        # Linux/macOS\n        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"KEY_PATH\"\n\n        # Windows\n        set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH\n\n        # Replace KEY_PATH with the path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.\n        ```\n\n        To use Spanner with the emulator you should set `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable:\n\n        ```shell\n        # Linux/macOS\n        export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010\n\n        # Windows\n        set SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010\n        ```\n\n    - for **MongoDB** (experimental)\n\n        `npm install mongodb@^5.2.0 --save`\n\n    - for **NativeScript**, **react-native** and **Cordova**\n\n        Check [documentation of supported platforms](./docs/supported-platforms.md)\n\n    Install only _one_ of them, depending on which database you use.\n\n##### TypeScript configuration\n\nAlso, make sure you are using TypeScript version **4.5** or higher,\nand you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n\"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n\"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n```\n\nYou may also need to enable `es6` in the `lib` section of compiler options, or install `es6-shim` from `@types`.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe quickest way to get started with TypeORM is to use its CLI commands to generate a starter project.\nQuick start works only if you are using TypeORM in a NodeJS application.\nIf you are using other platforms, proceed to the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).\n\nTo create a new project using CLI, run the following command:\n\n```shell\nnpx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres\n```\n\nWhere `name` is the name of your project and `database` is the database you'll use.\nDatabase can be one of the following values: `mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `sap`, `spanner`, `oracle`, `mongodb`,\n`cordova`, `react-native`, `expo`, `nativescript`.\n\nThis command will generate a new project in the `MyProject` directory with the following files:\n\n```\nMyProject\n├── src                   // place of your TypeScript code\n│   ├── entity            // place where your entities (database models) are stored\n│   │   └── User.ts       // sample entity\n│   ├── migration         // place where your migrations are stored\n│   ├── data-source.ts    // data source and all connection configuration\n│   └── index.ts          // start point of your application\n├── .gitignore            // standard gitignore file\n├── package.json          // node module dependencies\n├── README.md             // simple readme file\n└── tsconfig.json         // TypeScript compiler options\n```\n\n> You can also run `typeorm init` on an existing node project, but be careful - it may override some files you already have.\n\nThe next step is to install new project dependencies:\n\n```shell\ncd MyProject\nnpm install\n```\n\nAfter you have all dependencies installed, edit the `data-source.ts` file and put your own database connection configuration options in there:\n\n```ts\nexport const AppDataSource = new DataSource({\n    type: \"postgres\",\n    host: \"localhost\",\n    port: 5432,\n    username: \"test\",\n    password: \"test\",\n    database: \"test\",\n    synchronize: true,\n    logging: true,\n    entities: [Post, Category],\n    subscribers: [],\n    migrations: [],\n})\n```\n\nParticularly, most of the time you'll only need to configure\n`host`, `username`, `password`, `database` and maybe `port` options.\n\nOnce you finish with configuration and all node modules are installed, you can run your application:\n\n```shell\nnpm start\n```\n\nThat's it, your application should successfully run and insert a new user into the database.\nYou can continue to work with this project and integrate other modules you need and start\ncreating more entities.\n\n> You can generate an ESM project by running\n> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --module esm` command.\n\n> You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running\n> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express` command.\n\n> You can generate a docker-compose file by running\n> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --docker` command.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\nWhat are you expecting from ORM?\nFirst of all, you are expecting it will create database tables for you\nand find / insert / update / delete your data without the pain of\nhaving to write lots of hardly maintainable SQL queries.\nThis guide will show you how to set up TypeORM from scratch and make it do what you are expecting from an ORM.\n\n### Create a model\n\nWorking with a database starts from creating tables.\nHow do you tell TypeORM to create a database table?\nThe answer is - through the models.\nYour models in your app are your database tables.\n\nFor example, you have a `Photo` model:\n\n```javascript\nexport class Photo {\n    id: number\n    name: string\n    description: string\n    filename: string\n    views: number\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\nAnd you want to store photos in your database.\nTo store things in the database, first, you need a database table,\nand database tables are created from your models.\nNot all models, but only those you define as _entities_.\n\n### Create an entity\n\n_Entity_ is your model decorated by an `@Entity` decorator.\nA database table will be created for such models.\nYou work with entities everywhere in TypeORM.\nYou can load/insert/update/remove and perform other operations with them.\n\nLet's make our `Photo` model an entity:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    id: number\n    name: string\n    description: string\n    filename: string\n    views: number\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\nNow, a database table will be created for the `Photo` entity and we'll be able to work with it anywhere in our app.\nWe have created a database table, however, what table can exist without columns?\nLet's create few columns in our database table.\n\n### Adding table columns\n\nTo add database columns, you simply need to decorate an entity's properties you want to make into a column\nwith a `@Column` decorator.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    @Column()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    name: string\n\n    @Column()\n    description: string\n\n    @Column()\n    filename: string\n\n    @Column()\n    views: number\n\n    @Column()\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\nNow `id`, `name`, `description`, `filename`, `views` and `isPublished` columns will be added to the `photo` table.\nColumn types in the database are inferred from the property types you used, e.g.\n`number` will be converted into `integer`, `string` into `varchar`, `boolean` into `bool`, etc.\nBut you can use any column type your database supports by explicitly specifying a column type into the `@Column` decorator.\n\nWe generated a database table with columns, but there is one thing left.\nEach database table must have a column with a primary key.\n\n### Creating a primary column\n\nEach entity **must** have at least one primary key column.\nThis is a requirement and you can't avoid it.\nTo make a column a primary key, you need to use the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    @PrimaryColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    name: string\n\n    @Column()\n    description: string\n\n    @Column()\n    filename: string\n\n    @Column()\n    views: number\n\n    @Column()\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\n### Creating an auto-generated column\n\nNow, let's say you want your id column to be auto-generated (this is known as auto-increment / sequence / serial / generated identity column).\nTo do that, you need to change the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator to a `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    name: string\n\n    @Column()\n    description: string\n\n    @Column()\n    filename: string\n\n    @Column()\n    views: number\n\n    @Column()\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\n### Column data types\n\nNext, let's fix our data types. By default, the string is mapped to a varchar(255)-like type (depending on the database type).\nThe number is mapped to an integer-like type (depending on the database type).\nWe don't want all our columns to be limited varchars or integers.\nLet's setup correct data types:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column({\n        length: 100,\n    })\n    name: string\n\n    @Column(\"text\")\n    description: string\n\n    @Column()\n    filename: string\n\n    @Column(\"double\")\n    views: number\n\n    @Column()\n    isPublished: boolean\n}\n```\n\nColumn types are database-specific.\nYou can set any column type your database supports.\nMore information on supported column types can be found [here](./docs/entities.md#column-types).\n\n### Creating a new `DataSource`\n\nNow, when our entity is created, let's create `index.ts` file and set up our `DataSource` there:\n\n```javascript\nimport \"reflect-metadata\"\nimport { DataSource } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\n\nconst AppDataSource = new DataSource({\n    type: \"postgres\",\n    host: \"localhost\",\n    port: 5432,\n    username: \"root\",\n    password: \"admin\",\n    database: \"test\",\n    entities: [Photo],\n    synchronize: true,\n    logging: false,\n})\n\n// to initialize initial connection with the database, register all entities\n// and \"synchronize\" database schema, call \"initialize()\" method of a newly created database\n// once in your application bootstrap\nAppDataSource.initialize()\n    .then(() => {\n        // here you can start to work with your database\n    })\n    .catch((error) => console.log(error))\n```\n\nWe are using Postgres in this example, but you can use any other supported database.\nTo use another database, simply change the `type` in the options to the database type you are using:\n`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `sap`, `spanner`, `cordova`, `nativescript`, `react-native`,\n`expo`, or `mongodb`.\nAlso make sure to use your own host, port, username, password and database settings.\n\nWe added our Photo entity to the list of entities for this data source.\nEach entity you are using in your connection must be listed there.\n\nSetting `synchronize` makes sure your entities will be synced with the database, every time you run the application.\n\n### Running the application\n\nNow if you run your `index.ts`, a connection with the database will be initialized and a database table for your photos will be created.\n\n```shell\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n|                         photo                           |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |\n| name        | varchar(100) |                            |\n| description | text         |                            |\n| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |\n| views       | int(11)      |                            |\n| isPublished | boolean      |                            |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n```\n\n### Creating and inserting a photo into the database\n\nNow let's create a new photo to save it in the database:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photo = new Photo()\nphoto.name = \"Me and Bears\"\nphoto.description = \"I am near polar bears\"\nphoto.filename = \"photo-with-bears.jpg\"\nphoto.views = 1\nphoto.isPublished = true\n\nawait AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)\nconsole.log(\"Photo has been saved. Photo id is\", photo.id)\n```\n\nOnce your entity is saved it will get a newly generated id.\n`save` method returns an instance of the same object you pass to it.\nIt's not a new copy of the object, it modifies its \"id\" and returns it.\n\n### Using Entity Manager\n\nWe just created a new photo and saved it in the database.\nWe used `EntityManager` to save it.\nUsing entity manager you can manipulate any entity in your app.\nFor example, let's load our saved entity:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst savedPhotos = await AppDataSource.manager.find(Photo)\nconsole.log(\"All photos from the db: \", savedPhotos)\n```\n\n`savedPhotos` will be an array of Photo objects with the data loaded from the database.\n\nLearn more about EntityManager [here](./docs/working-with-entity-manager.md).\n\n### Using Repositories\n\nNow let's refactor our code and use `Repository` instead of `EntityManager`.\nEach entity has its own repository which handles all operations with its entity.\nWhen you deal with entities a lot, Repositories are more convenient to use than EntityManagers:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photo = new Photo()\nphoto.name = \"Me and Bears\"\nphoto.description = \"I am near polar bears\"\nphoto.filename = \"photo-with-bears.jpg\"\nphoto.views = 1\nphoto.isPublished = true\n\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\n\nawait photoRepository.save(photo)\nconsole.log(\"Photo has been saved\")\n\nconst savedPhotos = await photoRepository.find()\nconsole.log(\"All photos from the db: \", savedPhotos)\n```\n\nLearn more about Repository [here](./docs/working-with-repository.md).\n\n### Loading from the database\n\nLet's try more load operations using the Repository:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\nconst allPhotos = await photoRepository.find()\nconsole.log(\"All photos from the db: \", allPhotos)\n\nconst firstPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({\n    id: 1,\n})\nconsole.log(\"First photo from the db: \", firstPhoto)\n\nconst meAndBearsPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({\n    name: \"Me and Bears\",\n})\nconsole.log(\"Me and Bears photo from the db: \", meAndBearsPhoto)\n\nconst allViewedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ views: 1 })\nconsole.log(\"All viewed photos: \", allViewedPhotos)\n\nconst allPublishedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ isPublished: true })\nconsole.log(\"All published photos: \", allPublishedPhotos)\n\nconst [photos, photosCount] = await photoRepository.findAndCount()\nconsole.log(\"All photos: \", photos)\nconsole.log(\"Photos count: \", photosCount)\n```\n\n### Updating in the database\n\nNow let's load a single photo from the database, update it and save it:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\nconst photoToUpdate = await photoRepository.findOneBy({\n    id: 1,\n})\nphotoToUpdate.name = \"Me, my friends and polar bears\"\nawait photoRepository.save(photoToUpdate)\n```\n\nNow photo with `id = 1` will be updated in the database.\n\n### Removing from the database\n\nNow let's remove our photo from the database:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\nconst photoToRemove = await photoRepository.findOneBy({\n    id: 1,\n})\nawait photoRepository.remove(photoToRemove)\n```\n\nNow photo with `id = 1` will be removed from the database.\n\n### Creating a one-to-one relation\n\nLet's create a one-to-one relationship with another class.\nLet's create a new class in `PhotoMetadata.ts`. This PhotoMetadata class is supposed to contain our photo's additional meta-information:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    Column,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    OneToOne,\n    JoinColumn,\n} from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Photo } from \"./Photo\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class PhotoMetadata {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column(\"int\")\n    height: number\n\n    @Column(\"int\")\n    width: number\n\n    @Column()\n    orientation: string\n\n    @Column()\n    compressed: boolean\n\n    @Column()\n    comment: string\n\n    @OneToOne(() => Photo)\n    @JoinColumn()\n    photo: Photo\n}\n```\n\nHere, we are using a new decorator called `@OneToOne`. It allows us to create a one-to-one relationship between two entities.\n`type => Photo` is a function that returns the class of the entity with which we want to make our relationship.\nWe are forced to use a function that returns a class, instead of using the class directly, because of the language specifics.\nWe can also write it as `() => Photo`, but we use `type => Photo` as a convention to increase code readability.\nThe type variable itself does not contain anything.\n\nWe also add a `@JoinColumn` decorator, which indicates that this side of the relationship will own the relationship.\nRelations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.\nOnly one side of relational can be owning.\nUsing `@JoinColumn` decorator is required on the owner side of the relationship.\n\nIf you run the app, you'll see a newly generated table, and it will contain a column with a foreign key for the photo relation:\n\n```shell\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n|                     photo_metadata                      |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |\n| height      | int(11)      |                            |\n| width       | int(11)      |                            |\n| comment     | varchar(255) |                            |\n| compressed  | boolean      |                            |\n| orientation | varchar(255) |                            |\n| photoId     | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n```\n\n### Save a one-to-one relation\n\nNow let's save a photo, its metadata and attach them to each other.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./entity/PhotoMetadata\"\n\n// create a photo\nconst photo = new Photo()\nphoto.name = \"Me and Bears\"\nphoto.description = \"I am near polar bears\"\nphoto.filename = \"photo-with-bears.jpg\"\nphoto.views = 1\nphoto.isPublished = true\n\n// create a photo metadata\nconst metadata = new PhotoMetadata()\nmetadata.height = 640\nmetadata.width = 480\nmetadata.compressed = true\nmetadata.comment = \"cybershoot\"\nmetadata.orientation = \"portrait\"\nmetadata.photo = photo // this way we connect them\n\n// get entity repositories\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\nconst metadataRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(PhotoMetadata)\n\n// first we should save a photo\nawait photoRepository.save(photo)\n\n// photo is saved. Now we need to save a photo metadata\nawait metadataRepository.save(metadata)\n\n// done\nconsole.log(\n    \"Metadata is saved, and the relation between metadata and photo is created in the database too\",\n)\n```\n\n### Inverse side of the relationship\n\nRelations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.\nCurrently, our relation between PhotoMetadata and Photo is unidirectional.\nThe owner of the relation is PhotoMetadata, and Photo doesn't know anything about PhotoMetadata.\nThis makes it complicated to access PhotoMetadata from the Photo side.\nTo fix this issue we should add an inverse relation, and make relations between PhotoMetadata and Photo bidirectional.\nLet's modify our entities:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    Column,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    OneToOne,\n    JoinColumn,\n} from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Photo } from \"./Photo\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class PhotoMetadata {\n    /* ... other columns */\n\n    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)\n    @JoinColumn()\n    photo: Photo\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./PhotoMetadata\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    /* ... other columns */\n\n    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)\n    metadata: PhotoMetadata\n}\n```\n\n`photo => photo.metadata` is a function that returns the name of the inverse side of the relation.\nHere we show that the metadata property of the Photo class is where we store PhotoMetadata in the Photo class.\nInstead of passing a function that returns a property of the photo, you could alternatively simply pass a string to `@OneToOne` decorator, like `\"metadata\"`.\nBut we used this function-typed approach to make our refactoring easier.\n\nNote that we should use the `@JoinColumn` decorator only on one side of a relation.\nWhichever side you put this decorator on will be the owning side of the relationship.\nThe owning side of a relationship contains a column with a foreign key in the database.\n\n### Relations in ESM projects\n\nIf you use ESM in your TypeScript project, you should use the `Relation` wrapper type in relation properties to avoid circular dependency issues.\nLet's modify our entities:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    Column,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    OneToOne,\n    JoinColumn,\n    Relation,\n} from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Photo } from \"./Photo\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class PhotoMetadata {\n    /* ... other columns */\n\n    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)\n    @JoinColumn()\n    photo: Relation<Photo>\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    Column,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    OneToOne,\n    Relation,\n} from \"typeorm\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./PhotoMetadata\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    /* ... other columns */\n\n    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)\n    metadata: Relation<PhotoMetadata>\n}\n```\n\n### Loading objects with their relations\n\nNow let's load our photo and its photo metadata in a single query.\nThere are two ways to do it - using `find*` methods or using `QueryBuilder` functionality.\nLet's use `find*` methods first.\n`find*` methods allow you to specify an object with the `FindOneOptions` / `FindManyOptions` interface.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./entity/PhotoMetadata\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\nconst photos = await photoRepository.find({\n    relations: {\n        metadata: true,\n    },\n})\n```\n\nHere, photos will contain an array of photos from the database, and each photo will contain its photo metadata.\nLearn more about Find Options in [this documentation](./docs/find-options.md).\n\nUsing find options is good and dead simple, but if you need a more complex query, you should use `QueryBuilder` instead.\n`QueryBuilder` allows more complex queries to be used in an elegant way:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Photo } from \"./entity/Photo\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./entity/PhotoMetadata\"\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\nconst photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\n    .createQueryBuilder(\"photo\")\n    .innerJoinAndSelect(\"photo.metadata\", \"metadata\")\n    .getMany()\n```\n\n`QueryBuilder` allows the creation and execution of SQL queries of almost any complexity.\nWhen you work with `QueryBuilder`, think like you are creating an SQL query.\nIn this example, \"photo\" and \"metadata\" are aliases applied to selected photos.\nYou use aliases to access columns and properties of the selected data.\n\n### Using cascades to automatically save related objects\n\nWe can set up cascade options in our relations, in the cases when we want our related object to be saved whenever the other object is saved.\nLet's change our photo's `@OneToOne` decorator a bit:\n\n```javascript\nexport class Photo {\n    // ... other columns\n\n    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (metadata) => metadata.photo, {\n        cascade: true,\n    })\n    metadata: PhotoMetadata\n}\n```\n\nUsing `cascade` allows us not to separately save photo and separately save metadata objects now.\nNow we can simply save a photo object, and the metadata object will be saved automatically because of cascade options.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\n// create photo object\nconst photo = new Photo()\nphoto.name = \"Me and Bears\"\nphoto.description = \"I am near polar bears\"\nphoto.filename = \"photo-with-bears.jpg\"\nphoto.isPublished = true\n\n// create photo metadata object\nconst metadata = new PhotoMetadata()\nmetadata.height = 640\nmetadata.width = 480\nmetadata.compressed = true\nmetadata.comment = \"cybershoot\"\nmetadata.orientation = \"portrait\"\n\nphoto.metadata = metadata // this way we connect them\n\n// get repository\nconst photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\n\n// saving a photo also save the metadata\nawait photoRepository.save(photo)\n\nconsole.log(\"Photo is saved, photo metadata is saved too.\")\n```\n\nNotice that we now set the photo's `metadata` property, instead of the metadata's `photo` property as before. The `cascade` feature only works if you connect the photo to its metadata from the photo's side. If you set the metadata's side, the metadata would not be saved automatically.\n\n### Creating a many-to-one / one-to-many relation\n\nLet's create a many-to-one/one-to-many relation.\nLet's say a photo has one author, and each author can have many photos.\nFirst, let's create an `Author` class:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    Column,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    OneToMany,\n    JoinColumn,\n} from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Photo } from \"./Photo\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Author {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    name: string\n\n    @OneToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.author) // note: we will create author property in the Photo class below\n    photos: Photo[]\n}\n```\n\n`Author` contains an inverse side of a relation.\n`OneToMany` is always an inverse side of the relation, and it can't exist without `ManyToOne` on the other side of the relation.\n\nNow let's add the owner side of the relation into the Photo entity:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { PhotoMetadata } from \"./PhotoMetadata\"\nimport { Author } from \"./Author\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Photo {\n    /* ... other columns */\n\n    @ManyToOne(() => Author, (author) => author.photos)\n    author: Author\n}\n```\n\nIn many-to-one / one-to-many relation, the owner side is always many-to-one.\nIt means that the class that uses `@ManyToOne` will store the id of the related object.\n\nAfter you run the application, the ORM will create the `author` table:\n\n```shell\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n|                          author                         |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |\n| name        | varchar(255) |                            |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n```\n\nIt will also modify the `photo` table, adding a new `author` column and creating a foreign key for it:\n\n```shell\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n|                         photo                           |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |\n| name        | varchar(255) |                            |\n| description | varchar(255) |                            |\n| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |\n| isPublished | boolean      |                            |\n| authorId    | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n```\n\n### Creating a many-to-many relation\n\nLet's create a many-to-many relation.\nLet's say a photo can be in many albums, and each album can contain many photos.\nLet's create an `Album` class:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    Entity,\n    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,\n    Column,\n    ManyToMany,\n    JoinTable,\n} from \"typeorm\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Album {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number\n\n    @Column()\n    name: string\n\n    @ManyToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.albums)\n    @JoinTable()\n    photos: Photo[]\n}\n```\n\n`@JoinTable` is required to specify that this is the owner side of the relationship.\n\nNow let's add the inverse side of our relation to the `Photo` class:\n\n```javascript\nexport class Photo {\n    // ... other columns\n\n    @ManyToMany(() => Album, (album) => album.photos)\n    albums: Album[]\n}\n```\n\nAfter you run the application, the ORM will create a **album_photos_photo_albums** _junction table_:\n\n```shell\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n|                album_photos_photo_albums                |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n| album_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |\n| photo_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |\n+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+\n```\n\nDon't forget to register the `Album` class with your connection in the ORM:\n\n```javascript\nconst options: DataSourceOptions = {\n    // ... other options\n    entities: [Photo, PhotoMetadata, Author, Album],\n}\n```\n\nNow let's insert albums and photos to our database:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDataSource } from \"./index\"\n\n// create a few albums\nconst album1 = new Album()\nalbum1.name = \"Bears\"\nawait AppDataSource.manager.save(album1)\n\nconst album2 = new Album()\nalbum2.name = \"Me\"\nawait AppDataSource.manager.save(album2)\n\n// create a few photos\nconst photo = new Photo()\nphoto.name = \"Me and Bears\"\nphoto.description = \"I am near polar bears\"\nphoto.filename = \"photo-with-bears.jpg\"\nphoto.views = 1\nphoto.isPublished = true\nphoto.albums = [album1, album2]\nawait AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)\n\n// now our photo is saved and albums are attached to it\n// now lets load them:\nconst loadedPhoto = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo).findOne({\n    where: {\n        id: 1,\n    },\n    relations: {\n        albums: true,\n    },\n})\n```\n\n`loadedPhoto` will be equal to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    id: 1,\n    name: \"Me and Bears\",\n    description: \"I am near polar bears\",\n    filename: \"photo-with-bears.jpg\",\n    albums: [{\n        id: 1,\n        name: \"Bears\"\n    }, {\n        id: 2,\n        name: \"Me\"\n    }]\n}\n```\n\n### Using QueryBuilder\n\nYou can use QueryBuilder to build SQL queries of almost any complexity. For example, you can do this:\n\n```javascript\nconst photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)\n    .createQueryBuilder(\"photo\") // first argument is an alias. Alias is what you are selecting - photos. You must specify it.\n    .innerJoinAndSelect(\"photo.metadata\", \"metadata\")\n    .leftJoinAndSelect(\"photo.albums\", \"album\")\n    .where(\"photo.isPublished = true\")\n    .andWhere(\"(photo.name = :photoName OR photo.name = :bearName)\")\n    .orderBy(\"photo.id\", \"DESC\")\n    .skip(5)\n    .take(10)\n    .setParameters({ photoName: \"My\", bearName: \"Mishka\" })\n    .getMany()\n```\n\nThis query selects all published photos with \"My\" or \"Mishka\" names.\nIt will select results from position 5 (pagination offset)\nand will select only 10 results (pagination limit).\nThe selection result will be ordered by id in descending order.\nThe photo's albums will be left joined and their metadata will be inner joined.\n\nYou'll use the query builder in your application a lot.\nLearn more about QueryBuilder [here](./docs/select-query-builder.md).\n\n## Samples\n\nTake a look at the samples in [sample](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/tree/master/sample) for examples of usage.\n\nThere are a few repositories which you can clone and start with:\n\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with TypeScript](https://github.com/typeorm/typescript-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with JavaScript](https://github.com/typeorm/javascript-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with JavaScript and Babel](https://github.com/typeorm/babel-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with TypeScript and SystemJS in Browser](https://github.com/typeorm/browser-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with TypeScript and React in Browser](https://github.com/ItayGarin/typeorm-react-swc)\n-   [Example how to use Express and TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typescript-express-example)\n-   [Example how to use Koa and TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typescript-koa-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with MongoDB](https://github.com/typeorm/mongo-typescript-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM in a Cordova/PhoneGap app](https://github.com/typeorm/cordova-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with an Ionic app](https://github.com/typeorm/ionic-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with React Native](https://github.com/typeorm/react-native-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with Nativescript-Vue](https://github.com/typeorm/nativescript-vue-typeorm-sample)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with Nativescript-Angular](https://github.com/betov18x/nativescript-angular-typeorm-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with Electron using JavaScript](https://github.com/typeorm/electron-javascript-example)\n-   [Example how to use TypeORM with Electron using TypeScript](https://github.com/typeorm/electron-typescript-example)\n\n## Extensions\n\nThere are several extensions that simplify working with TypeORM and integrating it with other modules:\n\n-   [TypeORM + GraphQL framework](https://github.com/vesper-framework/vesper)\n-   [TypeORM integration](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm-typedi-extensions) with [TypeDI](https://github.com/pleerock/typedi)\n-   [TypeORM integration](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm-routing-controllers-extensions) with [routing-controllers](https://github.com/pleerock/routing-controllers)\n-   Models generation from existing database - [typeorm-model-generator](https://github.com/Kononnable/typeorm-model-generator)\n-   Fixtures loader - [typeorm-fixtures-cli](https://github.com/RobinCK/typeorm-fixtures)\n-   ER Diagram generator - [typeorm-uml](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov/typeorm-uml/)\n-   another ER Diagram generator - [erdia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/erdia/)\n-   Create, drop & seed database - [typeorm-extension](https://github.com/tada5hi/typeorm-extension)\n-   Automatically update `data-source.ts` after generating migrations/entities - [typeorm-codebase-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeorm-codebase-sync)\n-   Easy manipulation of `relations` objects - [typeorm-relations](https://npmjs.com/package/typeorm-relations)\n-   Automatically generate `relations` based on a GraphQL query - [typeorm-relations-graphql](https://npmjs.com/package/typeorm-relations-graphql)\n\n## Contributing\n\nLearn about contribution [here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and how to setup your development environment [here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md).\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/typeorm/contributors.svg?width=890&showBtn=false\" /></a>\n\n## Sponsors\n\nOpen source is hard and time-consuming.
