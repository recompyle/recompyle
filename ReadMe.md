# Recompyle Documentation - [Website](https://www.recompyle.com)

A Javascript Developer Friendly Console / Debugger.

It let you debug your app more efficiently.

I have always been annoyed of the console.log not being practical enough, and 
the debugger "too slow".
So i made Recompyle to fix that, it solves multiple frictions of the 
debugging experience.

- Need to write console.log everywhere, then remove them.
- When you click on a filePath in chrome it opens in the dev console not in
the IDE.
- A log history better than "Preserve Log"
- A nicer JSON viewer ( Especially on Node.js )

# How it works

It parse you project & files, connect to your app
with the debugger api, set breakpoints, pause at X breakpoints, query
the state, resume the breakpoint. Kind of a mix of the debugger and the
console + some parsing.

# Requirements
- A Node.js or Browser App built with Javascript or Typescript.
- The Source Maps enabled ( it's generally enabled by default in 
  development )

  - will log the scope when you have a console.log.
  - will log the breakpoints in your IDE.

"Available" is a back pocket of your files

All files opened in your IDE are added to "Breakpoints"



Some explanation about MF, AF, Default ;
- MF = Main Functions = will logs all the first level functions.
- AF = ALL Functions = will logs all functions

# Configuration

Once you have selected a file in your IDE, recompyle will create a folder in 
you project ./recompyle/ inside there will be a 
- config.js : to change the ports and other apps settings, the settings are 
  explained in the file. some more detailed explanation for the most 
  important settings
  - scope.timeout  (300ms by default): The timeout to query an object in ms
    will show RecompyleMaxTimeout = true if the querying the data takes
    more that the timeout value. Increasing the timeout will make recompyle 
    slower at each breakpoint. If you need some data that is not showing, 
    increase the timeout as needed, then use the file data-filter.js to 
    query only the data needed. 
- data-filter.js : let you customize filter the data from the scope. it 
  takes time to query objects, by keeping only what you need it get faster.

- the "#" with extras infos  (scope.showHashtagInfos)
  - className
  - subType : show the subtype for some objects
  - ignored : the ignored keys from data-filter.js

# Roadmap 
- Show the result of Promise, Await, Callback, Subscription.
- Call method to get the data : right now recompyle log only values, it will

  configuration in data-filter.js ( callMethod : [string] )
- Make Recompyle work with testing framework.
