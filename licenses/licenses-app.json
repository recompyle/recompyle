Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2019 Google LLC\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

The script is shipped as a separate package. Run the following command to install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm i --save-dev @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n# Or if you use yarn\nyarn add -D @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n```\n\nThen run the following command:\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --base my/path\n```\n\n`base` defaults to `./src/app`.\n\nYou can use the `--removeOnDestroy` flag for empty `OnDestroy` methods removing.\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --removeOnDestroy\n```\n\nYou can remove the package once the migration is done.\n\n## Potential Pitfalls\n\n- The order of decorators is important, make sure to put `@UntilDestroy()` before the `@Component()` decorator.\n- When using [`overrideComponent`](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/TestBed#overrideComponent) in unit tests remember that it overrides metadata and component definition. Invoke `UntilDestroy()(YourComponent);` to reapply the decorator. See [here](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/issues/91#issuecomment-626470446) for an example.\n\n## ESLint Rules\n\n- [prefer-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs-angular/blob/main/docs/rules/prefer-takeuntil.md#options)\n- [no-unsafe-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs/blob/main/docs/rules/no-unsafe-takeuntil.md#options)\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.netbasal.com\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6745730?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Netanel Basal</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#ideas-NetanelBasal\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@overthesanity\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7337691?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Artur Androsovych</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=arturovt\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#example-arturovt\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#ideas-arturovt\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a> <a href=\"#infra-arturovt\" title=\"Infrastructure (Hosting, Build-Tools, etc)\">🚇</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/KrzysztofKarol\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12470911?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Krzysztof Karol</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#content-KrzysztofKarol\" title=\"Content\">🖋</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gund\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644678?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Alex Malkevich</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=gund\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/webdevius\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2960769?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Khaled Shaaban</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=webdevius\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kmathy\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15690980?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>kmathy</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=kmathy\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/FFKL\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11336491?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Dmitrii Korostelev</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=FFKL\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

Import the `TranslateModule`:\n\nFinally, you can use ngx-translate in your Angular project. You have to import `TranslateModule.forRoot()` in the root NgModule of your application.\n\nThe [`forRoot`](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterModule#forroot) static method is a convention that provides and configures services at the same time.\nMake sure you only call this method in the root module of your application, most of the time called `AppModule`.\nThis method allows you to configure the `TranslateModule` by specifying a loader, a parser and/or a missing translations handler.\n\n```ts\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {TranslateModule} from '@ngx-translate/core';\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot()\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n##### SharedModule\n\nIf you use a [`SharedModule`](https://angular.io/guide/sharing-ngmodules) that you import in multiple other feature modules,\nyou can export the `TranslateModule` to make sure you don't have to import it in every module.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n    exports: [\n        CommonModule,\n        TranslateModule\n    ]\n})\nexport class SharedModule { }\n```\n\n> Note: Never call a `forRoot` static method in the `SharedModule`. You might end up with different instances of the service in your injector tree. But you can use `forChild` if necessary.\n\n##### Lazy loaded modules\n\nWhen you lazy load a module, you should use the `forChild` static method to import the `TranslateModule`.\n\nSince lazy loaded modules use a different injector from the rest of your application, you can configure them separately with a different loader/compiler/parser/missing translations handler.\n\nTo make a child module extend translations from parent modules use `extend: true`. This will cause the service to also\nuse translations from its parent module.\n\nYou can also isolate the service by using `isolate: true`. In which case the service is a completely isolated instance (for translations, current lang, events, ...).\nOtherwise, by default, it will share its data with other instances of the service (but you can still use a different loader/compiler/parser/handler even if you don't isolate the service).\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        TranslateModule.forChild({\n            loader: {provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: CustomLoader},\n            compiler: {provide: TranslateCompiler, useClass: CustomCompiler},\n            parser: {provide: TranslateParser, useClass: CustomParser},\n            missingTranslationHandler: {provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: CustomHandler},\n            isolate: true\n        })\n    ]\n})\nexport class LazyLoadedModule { }\n```\n\n##### Configuration\n\nBy default, there is no loader available. You can add translations manually using `setTranslation` but it is better to use a loader.\nYou can write your own loader, or import an existing one.\nFor example you can use the [`TranslateHttpLoader`](https://github.com/ngx-translate/http-loader) that will load translations from files using HttpClient.\n\nTo use it, you need to install the http-loader package from @ngx-translate:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @ngx-translate/http-loader --save\n```\n\n**NB: if you're still on Angular <4.3, please use Http from @angular/http with http-loader@0.1.0.**\n\nOnce you've decided which loader to use, you have to setup the `TranslateModule` to use it.\n\nHere is how you would use the `TranslateHttpLoader` to load translations from \"/assets/i18n/[lang].json\" (`[lang]` is the lang that you're using, for english it could be `en`):\n\n```ts\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {HttpClientModule, HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';\nimport {TranslateModule, TranslateLoader} from '@ngx-translate/core';\nimport {TranslateHttpLoader} from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';\nimport {AppComponent} from './app';\n\n// AoT requires an exported function for factories\nexport function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {\n    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        HttpClientModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot({\n            loader: {\n                provide: TranslateLoader,\n                useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,\n                deps: [HttpClient]\n            }\n        })\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n##### AoT\n\nIf you want to configure a custom `TranslateLoader` while using [AoT compilation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) or [Ionic](http://ionic.io/), you must use an exported function instead of an inline function.\n\n```ts\nexport function createTranslateLoader(http: HttpClient) {\n    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http, './assets/i18n/', '.json');\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        HttpClientModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot({\n            loader: {\n                provide: TranslateLoader,\n                useFactory: (createTranslateLoader),\n                deps: [HttpClient]\n            }\n        })\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n#### 2. Define the `default language` for the application\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot({\n            defaultLanguage: 'en'\n        })\n    ],\n    providers: [\n\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n#### 3. Init the `TranslateService` for your application:\n\n```ts\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\nimport {TranslateService} from '@ngx-translate/core';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app',\n    template: `\n        <div>{{ 'HELLO' | translate:param }}</div>\n    `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    param = {value: 'world'};\n\n    constructor(translate: TranslateService) {\n        // this language will be used as a fallback when a translation isn't found in the current language\n        translate.setDefaultLang('en');\n\n         // the lang to use, if the lang isn't available, it will use the current loader to get them\n        translate.use('en');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Define the translations:\n\nOnce you've imported the `TranslateModule`, you can put your translations in a json file that will be imported with the `TranslateHttpLoader`. The following translations should be stored in `en.json`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"HELLO\": \"hello {{value}}\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also define your translations manually with `setTranslation`.\n\n```ts\ntranslate.setTranslation('en', {\n    HELLO: 'hello {{value}}'\n});\n```\n\nThe `TranslateParser` understands nested JSON objects. This means that you can have a translation that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"HOME\": {\n        \"HELLO\": \"hello {{value}}\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then access the value by using the dot notation, in this case `HOME.HELLO`.\n\n#### 5. Use the service, the pipe or the directive:\n\nYou can either use the `TranslateService`, the `TranslatePipe` or the `TranslateDirective` to get your translation values.\n\nWith the **service**, it looks like this:\n\n```ts\ntranslate.get('HELLO', {value: 'world'}).subscribe((res: string) => {\n    console.log(res);\n    //=> 'hello world'\n});\n```\n\nThis is how you do it with the **pipe**:\n\n```html\n<div>{{ 'HELLO' | translate:param }}</div>\n```\n\nAnd in your component define `param` like this:\n```ts\nparam = {value: 'world'};\n```\n\nYou can construct the translation keys dynamically by using simple string concatenation inside the template:\n\n```html\n<ul *ngFor=\"let language of languages\">\n  <li>{{ 'LANGUAGES.' + language | translate }}</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nWhere `languages` is an array member of your component:\n\n```ts\nlanguages = ['EN', 'FR', 'BG'];\n```\n\nYou can also use the output of the built-in pipes `uppercase` and `lowercase` in order to guarantee that your dynamically generated translation keys are either all uppercase or all lowercase. For example:\n\n```html\n<p>{{ 'ROLES.' + role | uppercase | translate }}</p>\n```\n\n```ts\nrole = 'admin';\n```\n\nwill match the following translation:\n```json\n{\n  \"ROLES\": {\n    \"ADMIN\": \"Administrator\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is how you use the **directive**:\n```html\n<div [translate]=\"'HELLO'\" [translateParams]=\"{value: 'world'}\"></div>\n```\n\nOr even simpler using the content of your element as a key:\n```html\n<div translate [translateParams]=\"{value: 'world'}\">HELLO</div>\n```\n\n#### 6. Use HTML tags:\n\nYou can easily use raw HTML tags within your translations.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"HELLO\": \"Welcome to my Angular application!<br><strong>This is an amazing app which uses the latest technologies!</strong>\"\n}\n```\n\nTo render them, simply use the `innerHTML` attribute with the pipe on any element.\n\n```html\n<div [innerHTML]=\"'HELLO' | translate\"></div>\n```\n\n## API\n\n### TranslateService\n\n#### Properties:\n\n- `currentLang`: The lang currently used\n- `currentLoader`: An instance of the loader currently used (static loader by default)\n- `onLangChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to lang change events. A `LangChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).\n\n    example:\n    ```ts\n    onLangChange.subscribe((event: LangChangeEvent) => {\n\t  // do something\n\t});\n    ```\n- `onTranslationChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to translation change events. A `TranslationChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).\n\n    example:\n    ```ts\n    onTranslationChange.subscribe((event: TranslationChangeEvent) => {\n\t  // do something\n\t});\n    ```\n- `onDefaultLangChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to default lang change events. A `DefaultLangChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).\n\n    example:\n    ```ts\n    onDefaultLangChange.subscribe((event: DefaultLangChangeEvent) => {\n\t  // do something\n\t});\n    ```\n\n#### Methods:\n\n- `setDefaultLang(lang: string)`: Sets the default language to use as a fallback\n- `getDefaultLang(): string`: Gets the default language\n- `use(lang: string): Observable<any>`: Changes the lang currently used\n- `getTranslation(lang: string): Observable<any>`: Gets an object of translations for a given language with the current loader\n- `setTranslation(lang: string, translations: Object, shouldMerge: boolean = false)`: Manually sets an object of translations for a given language, set `shouldMerge` to true if you want to append the translations instead of replacing them\n- `addLangs(langs: Array<string>)`: Add new langs to the list\n- `getLangs()`: Returns an array of currently available langs\n- `get(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Gets the translated value of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found\n- `getStreamOnTranslationChange(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Returns a stream of translated values of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found. Without any `onTranslationChange` events this returns the same value as `get` but it will also emit new values whenever the translation changes.\n- `stream(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Returns a stream of translated values of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found. Without any `onLangChange` events this returns the same value as `get` but it will also emit new values whenever the used language changes.\n- `instant(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): string|Object`: Gets the instant translated value of a key (or an array of keys). /!\\ This method is **synchronous** and the default file loader is asynchronous. You are responsible for knowing when your translations have been loaded and it is safe to use this method. If you are not sure then you should use the `get` method instead.\n- `set(key: string, value: string, lang?: string)`: Sets the translated value of a key\n- `reloadLang(lang: string): Observable<string|Object>`: Calls resetLang and retrieves the translations object for the current loader\n- `resetLang(lang: string)`: Removes the current translations for this lang. /!\\ You will have to call `use`, `reloadLang` or `getTranslation` again to be able to get translations\n- `getBrowserLang(): string | undefined`: Returns the current browser lang if available, or undefined otherwise\n- `getBrowserCultureLang(): string | undefined`: Returns the current browser culture language name (e.g. \"de-DE\" if available, or undefined otherwise\n\n#### Write & use your own loader\n\nIf you want to write your own loader, you need to create a class that implements `TranslateLoader`. The only required method is `getTranslation` that must return an `Observable`. If your loader is synchronous, just use [`Observable.of`](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/of.md) to create an observable from your static value.\n\n##### Example\n\n```ts\nclass CustomLoader implements TranslateLoader {\n    getTranslation(lang: string): Observable<any> {\n        return Observable.of({KEY: 'value'});\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you've defined your loader, you can provide it in your configuration by adding it to its `providers` property.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot({\n            loader: {provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: CustomLoader}\n        })\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n[Another custom loader example with translations stored in Firebase](FIREBASE_EXAMPLE.md)\n\n#### How to use a compiler to preprocess translation values\n\nBy default, translation values are added \"as-is\". You can configure a `compiler` that implements `TranslateCompiler` to pre-process translation values when they are added (either manually or by a loader). A compiler has the following methods:\n\n- `compile(value: string, lang: string): string | Function`: Compiles a string to a function or another string.\n- `compileTranslations(translations: any, lang: string): any`:  Compiles a (possibly nested) object of translation values to a structurally identical object of compiled translation values.\n\nUsing a compiler opens the door for powerful pre-processing of translation values. As long as the compiler outputs a compatible interpolation string or an interpolation function, arbitrary input syntax can be supported.\n\n\n#### How to handle missing translations\n\nYou can setup a provider for the `MissingTranslationHandler` in the bootstrap of your application (recommended), or in the `providers` property of a component. It will be called when the requested translation is not available. The only required method is `handle` where you can do whatever you want. If this method returns a value or an observable (that should return a string), then this will be used. Just don't forget that it will be called synchronously from the `instant` method.\n\nYou can use `useDefaultLang` to decide whether default language string should be used when there is a missing translation in current language. Default value is true. If you set it to false, `MissingTranslationHandler` will be used instead of the default language string.\n\n##### Example:\n\nCreate a Missing Translation Handler\n\n```ts\nimport {MissingTranslationHandler, MissingTranslationHandlerParams} from '@ngx-translate/core';\n\nexport class MyMissingTranslationHandler implements MissingTranslationHandler {\n    handle(params: MissingTranslationHandlerParams) {\n        return 'some value';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSetup the Missing Translation Handler in your module import by adding it to the `forRoot` (or `forChild`) configuration.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        TranslateModule.forRoot({\n            missingTranslationHandler: {provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: MyMissingTranslationHandler},\n            useDefaultLang: false\n        })\n    ],\n    providers: [\n\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n### Parser\n\nIf you need it for some reason, you can use the `TranslateParser` service.\n\n#### Methods:\n- `interpolate(expr: string | Function, params?: any): string`: Interpolates a string to replace parameters or calls the interpolation function with the parameters.\n\n    `This is a {{ key }}` ==> `This is a value` with `params = { key: \"value\" }`\n    `(params) => \\`This is a ${params.key}\\` ==> `This is a value` with `params = { key: \"value\" }`\n- `getValue(target: any, key: string): any`:  Gets a value from an object by composed key\n     `parser.getValue({ key1: { keyA: 'valueI' }}, 'key1.keyA') ==> 'valueI'`\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### I'm getting an error `npm ERR! peerinvalid Peer [...]`\n\nIf you're using npm 2.x, upgrade to npm 3.x, because npm 2 doesn't handle peer dependencies well. With npm 2 you could only use fixed versions, but with npm 3 you can use `^` to use a newer version if available.\n\nIf you're already on npm 3, check if it's an error (`npm ERR!`) or a warning (`npm WARN!`), warning are just informative and if everything works then don't worry !\n\nIf you're using an old version of Angular and ngx-translate requires a newer version then you should consider upgrading your application to use the newer angular 2 version. There is always a reason when I upgrade the minimum dependencies of the library. Often it is because Angular had a breaking changes. If it's not an option for you, then check [the changelog](/releases) to know which version is the last compatible version for you.\n\n#### I want to hot reload the translations in my application but `reloadLang` does not work\n\nIf you want to reload the translations and see the update on all your components without reloading the page, you have to load the translations manually and call `setTranslation` function which triggers `onTranslationChange`.\n\n## Plugins\n- [Localize Router](https://github.com/Greentube/localize-router) by @meeroslav: An implementation of routes localization for Angular.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

You can easily find and manipulate TS and Ng entities.\n\n✅ You work with an abstract tree and it can be replaced,\nfor example, with virtual tree for testing instead of real file system.\nSo, you can test your schematics rapidly fast.\n\n## How to start\n\nInstall the package and visit our [documentation](https://tinkoff.github.io/ng-morph/)\n\n## Core team\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n       <td align=\"center\">\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katsuba_igor\"\n                ><img\n                    src=\"https://github.com/IKatsuba.png?size=100\"\n                    width=\"100\"\n                    style=\"margin-bottom: -4px; border-radius: 8px;\"\n                    alt=\"Igor Katsuba\"\n                /><br /><sub><b>Igor Katsuba</b></sub></a\n            >\n            <div style=\"margin-top: 4px\">\n                <a\n                    href=\"https://twitter.com/katsuba_igor\"\n                    title=\"Twitter\"\n                    ><img\n                        style=\"width: 16px;\"\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/twitter.svg\"\n                /></a>\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/IKatsuba\" title=\"Github\"\n                    ><img\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/github.svg\"\n                /></a>\n                <a\n                    href=\"https://t.me/Katsuba\"\n                    title=\"Telegram\"\n                    ><img\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/send.svg\"\n                /></a>\n            </div>\n        </td>\n        <td align=\"center\">\n            <a href=\"http://marsibarsi.me\"\n                ><img\n                    src=\"https://github.com/marsibarsi.png?size=100\"\n                    width=\"100\"\n                    style=\"margin-bottom: -4px; border-radius: 8px;\"\n                    alt=\"Roman Sedov\"\n                /><br /><b>Roman Sedov</b></a\n            >\n            <div style=\"margin-top: 4px\">\n                <a\n                    href=\"https://twitter.com/marsibarsi\"\n                    title=\"Twitter\"\n                    ><img\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/twitter.svg\"\n                /></a>\n                <a\n                    href=\"https://github.com/marsibarsi\"\n                    title=\"GitHub\"\n                    ><img\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/github.svg\"\n                /></a>\n                <a\n                    href=\"https://t.me/marsibarsi\"\n                    title=\"Telegram\"\n                    ><img\n                        width=\"16\"\n                        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feathericons/feather/master/icons/send.svg\"\n                /></a>\n            </div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n## License\n\n🆓 Feel free to use our library in your commercial and private applications\n\nAll ng-morph packages are covered by [Apache 2.0](/LICENSE)\n\nRead more about this license [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)"

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app\nwill automatically reload if you change\nany of the source files.\nYou should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy\nconfiguration by default.\n\n## Code scaffolding\n\nRun `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can\nalso use\n`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.\n\nIf you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)\nglobally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,\nyou can also use the command `ng generate` directly.\n\n## Additional tools\n\nTasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help\nor go check out the\n[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).\n\n## Code formatting\n\nAll `.ts`, `.js` & `.scss` files in this project are formatted automatically\nusing [Prettier](https://prettier.io),\nand enforced via the `test:ci` script.\n\nA pre-commit git hook has been configured on this project to automatically\nformat staged files, using\n(pretty-quick)[https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick], so you don't have to care\nfor it.\n\nYou can also force code formatting by running the command `npm run prettier`.\n\n# What's in the box\n\nThe app template is based\non [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org)\nand\n[Sass](http://sass-lang.com). The translation files use the\ncommon [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.\n\n#### Tools\n\nDevelopment, build and quality processes are based\non [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and\n[NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), which includes:\n\n- Optimized build and bundling process with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)\n- [Development server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)\n  with backend proxy and live reload\n- Cross-browser CSS with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)\n  and\n  [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)\n- Asset revisioning\n  for [better cache management](https://webpack.github.io/docs/long-term-caching.html)\n- Unit tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)\n  and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)\n- End-to-end tests using [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor)\n- Static code\n  analysis: [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer),\n  [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) and [HTMLHint](http://htmlhint.com/)\n- Local knowledgebase server using [Hads](https://github.com/sinedied/hads)\n- Automatic Angular documentation generation\n  using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app)\n- Automatic code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)\n\n#### Libraries\n\n- [Angular](https://angular.io)\n- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io)\n- [Angular Flex Layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)\n- [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/)\n- [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs)\n- [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core)\n- [Lodash](https://lodash.com)\n\n#### Coding guides\n\n- [Angular](docs/coding-guides/angular.md)\n- [TypeScript](docs/coding-guides/typescript.md)\n- [Sass](docs/coding-guides/sass.md)\n- [HTML](docs/coding-guides/html.md)\n- [Unit tests](docs/coding-guides/unit-tests.md)\n- [End-to-end tests](docs/coding-guides/e2e-tests.md)\n\n#### Other documentation\n\n- [I18n guide](docs/i18n.md)\n- [Working behind a corporate proxy](docs/corporate-proxy.md)\n- [Updating dependencies and tools](docs/updating.md)\n- [Using a backend proxy for development](docs/backend-proxy.md)\n- [Browser routing](docs/routing.md)"

If You\n    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n    as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n    meet the following conditions:\n\n    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n        stating that You changed the files; and\n\n    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n        the Derivative Works; and\n\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.
